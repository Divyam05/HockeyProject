<h1 id="ki" style="margin-left: 560px;color: white;font-family: Helvetica;">HISTORY OF HOCKEY</h1>
<h2 style="margin-left: 50px;color:#210070">Hockey and its Origins</h2>
<p class="bi">The roots of hockey are buried deep in antiquity. Historical records show that a crude form of the game was played in Egypt 4,000 years ago and in Ethiopia around 1,000BC, whilst an ancient form of the game was also played in Iran in around 2,000BC. 
Various museums offer evidence that a form of the game was played by the Romans and Greeks as well as by the Aztecs several centuries before Columbus arrived in the New World.
The modern game of hockey emerged in England in the mid-18th century and is largely attributed to the growth of public schools, such as Eton.
The first Hockey Association was formed in the UK in 1876 and drew up the first formal set of rules. The original association survived for just six years but, in 1886, it was revived by nine founding member clubs.</p><br><br>

<h2 style="margin-left: 50px;color:#210070">Hockey and the Olympics</h2>
<p class="bi">The inaugural Olympic Hockey Competition for men was held in London in 1908 with England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales competing separately. With the addition of Germany and France, the competition ran with six teams.
After having made its first appearance at the London Games, hockey was subsequently dropped from the 1912 Stockholm Games after host nations were granted control over ‘optional sports’. It reappeared in 1920 in Antwerp after pressure from Belgian hockey advocates before being omitted again in Paris in 1924.
The formation of the International Hockey Federation in 1924 was not soon enough for the Paris Olympics but it did grant hockey re-entry in Amsterdam in 1928. Hockey has been on the programme ever since, with women's hockey included for the first time in Moscow in 1980.</p><br><br>
<h2 style="margin-left: 50px;color:#210070">Hockey and the FIH</h2>
<p class="bi">Motivated by hockey’s omission from the 1924 Paris Games, International Hockey Federation (FIH) was founded by Paul Léautey. M. Léautey, who would later become the first president of the FIH, called together seven National Federations to form the sport’s international governing body.
These founding members, which represented both men's and women's hockey in their countries, were Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Hungary, Spain and Switzerland.
Popularised in the late 19th century, the women’s game developed quickly in many countries. In 1927, the International Federation of Women's Hockey Associations (IFWHA) was formed. After celebrating their respective Golden Jubilees - the FIH in 1974 and the IFWHA in 1980 - the two organisations came together in 1982 to form the current FIH.
By 1964, there were already 50 countries affiliated with the FIH, as well as three Continental Associations - Africa, Pan America and Asia - and in 1974, there were 71 members. Today, the International Hockey Federation consists of five Continental Associations, 137 National Associations and is still growing.</p>
<p class="bi">The British Empire rule made hockey highly widespread in the Indian sub-continent in late 19th century. The first ever hockey club was established in Kolkata in year 1885.In the year 1895,the Beighton Cup tournament in Kolkata and Aga Khan Tournament in Maharashtra were organized.On the 7th day of November 1925 all hockey associations and clubs assembled in Gwalior.This gathering led to the establishment of the INDIAN HOCKEY FEDERATION (IHF).
India's first ever international trip was to New Zealand.India played 21 matches and won about 18 matches out of it.They notched 192 goals in those matches and DHYAN CHAND'S hockey skills flummonxed the opposition team in all the game.</p>
